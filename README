libi2c
======

Library aiming to provide I2C functionality for C programs.
Written completely in C, providing nice and clean interface.

One library and interface for all platforms, functions return error code
on unsupported platforms but compile with no problems.

Full library functionality now only on Linux, but hopefully expect
more platforms soon!

# Compile and use as a shared library
###############################################################################

To compile the library as a shared library run make, then make install as root.
The make install command will install the library in the /usr/lib/ directory
and the libi2c.h header file in the /usr/include/ directory.
If you don't want to use the make install command for some reason, just copy
the libi2c.so and libi2c.h files from the bin directory whereever you want.
When compiling your program, don't forget to link the shared library using
the -li2c flag.

# Use the library without any sharing
###############################################################################

Copy the libi2c.c and libi2c.h files from the src directory to your project
folder, include the libi2c.h header and use the library as normal.
Don't forget to add the libi2c.c file to be compiled with your program.
